# llmignore
A Node.js tool built with Bun and TypeScript to generate LLM context from a codebase using a .llmignore file. This tool helps developers working with large codebases by creating a structured file tree and including relevant file contents, while excluding unnecessary files like node_modules, lock files, and binaries.
